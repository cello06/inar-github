Education stands as one of the cornerstones of a society, and one of its most pivotal components
is the institution of schools. Schools serve as places where knowledge, skills, and values are
imparted, allowing individuals to develop themselves and contribute to the community.
Beyond imparting academic knowledge, schools also teach vital skills such as social interaction, a
sense of responsibility, and the ability to collaborate. These institutions provide opportunities for
children not only in subjects like reading, mathematics, or science but also in arts, sports, music,
and other areas.
